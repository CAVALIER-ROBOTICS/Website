             <p>The 2019 season, Deep Space, was CavBot’s first competitive season. 
                As a small team of 8 students and 1 mentor, we climbed the ranks 
                and attended the FIRST World's competition 2019. We competed at district 
                competitions in Channelview and Del Rio, where the team won the Highest 
                Rookie Award and Rookie All-Star Award with our robot Monolith. Qualifying 
                for the State competition in Austin, we earned one more rookie award, Rookie 
                Inspiration Award. We ended our rookie season by ranking 21st at Worlds. </p>

             <p>This season, our team grew in size and capability, now consisting of many 
                additional members and 2 new mentors. Our robot, D.O, competed at the Del 
                Rio district event, reached the finals, and won the Excellence in Engineering 
                Award. Sadly, the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic cut our season short and the 
                lab was shut down for the remainder of the season.</p>

              <p>After a year of quarantine, we opened our lab up to limited meetings and 
                  utilized online platforms to resume our outreach activities. We were able 
                  to help our community at a vulnerable time by distributing no-contact hand 
                  sanitizer dispensers and 3D-printed mask clips. We competed at a few at home 
                  competitions such as Game Design and Innovation. We participated with Percy 
                  in the offseason event Texas Cup and ranked 20th at the event.</p>

              <p>In this season, Rapid React, CavBots consisted of a team of 52 
                  members and a new programming mentor. We were able to build two robots this 
                  year, the practice bot “Boing 7492” and the competition bot “Artemis”. We 
                  made it to semi-finals at both Channelview and Amarillo, and won the 
                  Excellence in Engineering Award and the Industrial Design Award. Finally, 
                  we competed at the Texas District Championship. During this competition, 
                  we were able to get the first triple traversal in the world during playoffs! 
                  We have gained a lot of knowledge over the past four years, and our robot 
                  reflects that. With a tracking turret and swerve drive we created an 
                  advanced robot.</p>

                    We were able to build two robots this year, a practice bot and the competition bot "Kraken".
                    We competed at Channelview and Amarillo and won the Creativity Award thanks to our unique suction cup vacuum system.
                    During offseason at the Texas Robotics Invitational (TRI), our all-girl drive team placed second.

                <p>In this season, Crescendo, CavBots consisted of 34 team members.
                    We built two robots this year, a swerve chassis (Pancake) and a competition robot (Sentinel). We were able to
                    test a 100% NEO swerve drive with Pancake, which we later implemented in Sentinel. We also invested in an INTEL Realsense D435I global shutter
                    depth camera paired with an advanced ai-enabled coprocessor. With this setup we successfully implemented one of the first VSLAM systems in FRC
                    and leveraged it in competition to localize our robot dynamically and in all locations on the playing field. Coupled with AprilTag localization, we were able to accurately shoot while
                    moving from almost any point on the field. This season, we created a truly cutting-edge robot which implemented equally cutting-edge technology.
