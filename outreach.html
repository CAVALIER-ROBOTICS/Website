                to get them excited about the endless opportunities that can come from 
                engineering. We understand that the future lies in the hands of the youth.</p>

                <p>We created a public build blog for several reasons - primarily, we believe 
                    that having documentation is beneficial long-term for both people in and 
                    out of the team. Plus, for families, friends, teachers, and sponsors, being 
                    able to follow the team makes it feel much more personal. Additionally, we are 
                    transparent about our progress, sharing both the good and the bad, so others 
                    can learn from what we encounter and struggle with throughout the season.</p>

                <p>From 2019 to 2021 we mentored at three different elementary and intermediate public 
                    schools in Houston, Texas. Every one of us has had fantastic experiences 
                    with FIRST, and we need to share that with the children in our community. 
                    We understand that by mentoring FLL teams we are encouraging future STEM leaders. </p>

                <p>During the unpredictable havoc of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to have 
                    an amazing, positive impact on the lives of so many. With schools opening up 
                    Fall of 2020, we saw a great need for ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 
                    We designed and manufactured contact-free hand sanitizer pumps for each teacher 
                    in Conroe ISD for students to disinfect their hands. As well, our team produced 
                    face shields for the courageous and selfless responders to keep them safe from 
                    the virus. So many people in our community have contributed to our PPE efforts 
                    and helped make a real difference in this world.</p>
